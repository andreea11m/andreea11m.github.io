The fetchAndDrawImage() function starts by using the fetch() method to retrieve a random image of a dog from the '[https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)' API endpoint. The fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to a Response object. The .then() method is used to wait for the promise to resolve and parse the response as json using response.json().

Once the JSON data is received, the function extracts the URL of the image from the JSON data using data.message. This URL is then used to create an Image object, which is then loaded using the src property. Once the image is loaded, the onload event is fired, which triggers the image to be drawn onto the canvas element with the id of "original" using the drawImage() method of the canvas context.

The mirrorImageHorizontally() function starts by getting the canvas element with the id of "mirrored" and its context. It then clears any content on the canvas using the clearRect() method. After that, it draws the original image onto the canvas using the drawImage() method. 

It then uses the translate() method to move the canvas context to the right side of the canvas, and the scale() method to flip the image horizontally by setting the x-axis scaling factor to -1.

The mirrorImageVertically() function is similar to the mirrorImageHorizontally() function, it starts by getting the canvas element with the id of "mirrored" and its context. It then clears any content on the canvas using the clearRect() method. After that, it draws the original image onto the canvas using the drawImage() method.

It then uses the translate() method to move the canvas context to the bottom of the canvas, and the scale() method to flip the image vertically by setting the y-axis scaling factor to -1.

In both function it uses clearRect method to clear the canvas, it's used to clear a rectangular area on the canvas and make it fully transparent.
